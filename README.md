# Handwritten-Devanagari-Recognition
In this project, a handwritten devanagari recognition system is implemented using Tensorflow to achieve 98.01 % accuracy.The dataset consists of 46 characters. The characters were written in A4 size paper which were scanned and cropped manually.The dataset comprises of 92000 images [32x32 px]. There are 1024 input features of pixel values in grayscale (0 to 255).
